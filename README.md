      <h3>How can you support Ukrainian civil society?</h3>
      All the help is valid, and if you are not able to help locally, by giving shelter to a fellow Ukraine, there are some ways that you can help also:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Support the Ukraine Armed forces directly by sending funding to the open special accounts.<br />

        </li>
        <li>
          Help the ICRC (Red Cross) with donations.<br />

# Vue Storefront Next About You Cloud Integration

<a href="https://slack.vuestorefront.io">![Branch Develop](https://img.shields.io/badge/community%20chat-slack-FF1493.svg)</a>

> **Disclaimer:** This project is still in beta phase.

## How to start?

1. Configure packages/theme/nuxt.config.js to establish the connection to your About You Cloud store.

- host: 'https://yourwebsite.com/v1/',
- auth: object containing username and password authentication

2. Install all required dependencies:

```sh
yarn install or yarn
```

3. (optional) Then you can verify if everything works properly by building all three projects:

```sh
yarn build
```

4. If everything built properly, you can start creating your new integration with:

```sh
yarn dev
```
